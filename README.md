# STA Officers Log

Tools for character development in _Star Trek Adventures_ for Foundry VTT.

- Players have a new button on their values, "Use Value":
  - Marks the current log item with the value's use.
  - Checks to see if a callback is possible and prompts the player to make the callback (not not)
  - Adjusts determination automatically, and links logs to the one they callback to.
- The GM can start a new mission, which resets Determination and Stress on all character. Then, it creates log items on all main characters withe the mission's name.
- Sorts and organizes logs by name, date, or into "chain-order" to visualize character arcs.
- Adds support for Trauma and Scars in the 23rd Century Campaign guide.
- Adds a button to add mission directives to log items.
- When you complete a log or a milestone, adds a button to select a benefit.
